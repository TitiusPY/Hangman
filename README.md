# Hangman
Hangman game written in python including the words's file (.txt). IN GREEK

For correct execution you have to copy all the words from words.txt and paste them to a new file wich MUST be called words.txt in the same folder with the game. 
UUfortunately pyinstaller doesn't give me the property to add an additional file to my executable app :(
